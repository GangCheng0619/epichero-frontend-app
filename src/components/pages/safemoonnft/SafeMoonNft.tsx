                  &quot;As the worldâ€™s first NFT to give holders reflection
                  rewards in BNB, EpicHero is expected to be a true game
                  changer. You could say, EpicHero is the Safemoon of NFT.
                  EpicHero is the pioneer in this field and is committed to
                  bring more innovative ideas and applications to change the
                  whole GameFi space.&quot;

                  &quot;Currently, the token is priced at $0.4333 and the $1
                  mark seems quite possible for EPICHERO considering the extreme
                  hype created around it. If its growth pattern continues like
                  this, then $10 is a possible target for this NFT game
                  token.&quot;
